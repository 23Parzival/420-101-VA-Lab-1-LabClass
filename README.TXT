This is where I will put the answers to Lab 1, part V.

Part V:

#22 After calling the method it shows me the string I put as a name for each student.

#24 It says there are zero students because none have been added.

#31 0 --> Int
    "hello" --> String
    101 --> Int
    -1 --> Int
    true --> Boolean
    "33" --> String
    3.1415 --> Float

#32 Open the editor for the circle, add "private string name;". Then add
    "name = "   ";".

#33 public void send(String) 

#34 public void average(int number1, int number2) 

#35 Object, the page I am reading is an object (Ch.1) of class book(Objects 
    first with java).

#36 No, an object can only belong to one class that describes its attribute.
